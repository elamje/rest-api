# rest-api

This api is made to do a lot with a little. Namely, it will try to do something big with just ring and compojure, and maybe a json lib to push out a rest endpoint.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
